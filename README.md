# HackTX2020Backend
Backend for our HackTX 2020 mobile app

### Function and purpose

Our backend allows users to create an account and submit daily reports on their health. Data is aggregated in an SQL-type format in order to allow for
seamless server-side data analysis. 

### Discussing the accuracy of our system
Generally, we have observed that survey data tends to be relatively accurate as long as correspondents are willingly volunteering. Given this observeration,
we expect trends inferred from our collected data to have a reasonable margin of error.
